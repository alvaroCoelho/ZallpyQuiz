# ZallpyQuiz

project aimed at Zallpy's technical challenge.

It is basically an application about the origin of
vehicle fitters, where the user must answer some questions and obtain their
result as a percentage at the end of the questionnaire.
The questions should appear at random and should be consumed through
of an API.

For API it was used:

- a project's backend already exists and an endpoint has been added:

v1 / support / questions

- retrofit2 with jackson for JSON formatting;

The architecture selected in the application was MVP.
